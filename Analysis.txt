Suppose `calls.csv` file has `m` rows and `texts.csv` file has `n` rows.
For all the tasks we also need to include time complexity to read file: `O(m) + O(n)`. We assue that it is preprocessed.
- Task 0
Time Complexity: O(1)
Since we are just reading the first line.
- Task 1
Time Complexity: O(n) + O(m)
Since we need to iterate in all the records to find unique numbers. Operations in set takes O(1) time.
- Task 2
Time Complexity: O(m)
Since we need to iterate in the whole `calls.csv` file to find max duration call.
- Task 3
Time Complexity: O(mlog(m))
The list sorting takes the maximum time which is mlog(m).
- Task 4
Time Complexity: (m+n)log(m+n)
Since we need to find records from both the files which could be telemarketers and sort the list.
