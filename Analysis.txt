- Task 0
Time Complexity: O(1)
It is O(1) because the time to access something is independent of the number of items in the collection, as we are looking for a specific value, the last, and the first in this case.
- Task 1
Time Complexity: O(n)
Since we are looking for the worst-case situation, the notation for the containers is one character, for instance, n, since there are two for loops => O( n + n) => O(2n) and this reduced to O(n).
- Task 2
Time Complexity: O(n)
Since we need just to iterate in the whole `calls.csv` file to find max duration call.
- Task 3
Time Complexity: O(nlog(n))
Since we have 3 for loops => O(n)+O(n)+O(n) = O(n) and a sorting function => O(nlog(n)). Since sorting function is more time expensive than for loops therefore the final complexity becomes nlog(n).
- Task 4
Time Complexity: (n)log(n)
Since we have 2 for loops => O(n)+O(n) = O(n) and a sorting function => O(nlog(n)). Since sorting function is more time expensive than for loops therefore the final complexity becomes nlog(n).
